## About Me

I‚Äôm a lifelong technology enthusiast, just recently jumping into serious coding in my 30s‚Äîbut my roots go back to playing Putt-Putt and tinkering with DOS & QBasic on my family's Compaq Deskpro 386. I care deeply about privacy, security, and the power of efficient, well-designed software. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the belief that learning never stops.

- **Currently learning:**  
  - Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
  - Docker, Nginx, Ubuntu  
  - FreeCodeCamp‚Äôs Full Stack Developer curriculum  
  - Exploring Rust, Ruby, Swift, Tailwind, Proxmox, Pangolin  
  - Favorite tools: VS Code, Ghostty, MobaXTerm, Cursor, Bolt.new, Sublime, Figma

## My Goals
